FOREMOST - https://github.com/korczis/foremost.git
	Foremost is a program that recovers files based on their headers , footers and internal data structures , I find it useful when dealing with png images.
	It can be installed with apt however the source can be found on github.

	Useful commands:
	foremost -i file : extracts data from the given file.
	
STEGSOLVE
	Sometimes there is a message or a text hidden in the image itself and in order to view it you need to apply some color filters or 
	play with the color levels. You can do it with GIMP or Photoshop or any other image editing software but stegsolve made it easier. 
	itâ€™s a small java tool that applies many color filters on images.
	You can get it from https://github.com/eugenekolo/sec-tools/tree/master/stego/stegsolve/stegsolve
	
EXIFTOOL
	Sometimes important stuff is hidden in the metadata of the image or the file , exiftool can be very helpful to view the metadata of the files.
